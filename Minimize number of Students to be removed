N Students of different heights are attending an assembly. The heights of the students are represented by an array H[]. 
The problem is that if a student has less or equal height than the student standing in front of him, then he/she cannot see the assembly. 
Find the minimum number of students to be removed such that maximum possible number of students can see the assembly.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
H[] = {9, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5}
Output:
2
Explanation:
We can remove the students at 0 and 4th index.
which will leave the students with heights
1,2,3, and 5.


Solution:

int removeStudents(int H[], int n) {
        vector<int> v;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
          int x=H[i];
          auto it=lower_bound(v.begin(),v.end(),x);
          if(it==v.end())
            v.push_back(x);
          else
            *it=x;
        }
        return n-v.size();
    }
