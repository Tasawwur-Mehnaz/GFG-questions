Given an array with N distinct elements, convert the given array to a reduced form where all elements are in range from 0 to N-1. The order of elements is same, i.e., 
0 is placed in place of smallest element, 1 is placed for second smallest element, N-1 is placed for largest element.
Note: You don't have to return anything. You just have to change the the given array.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
Arr[] = {10, 40, 20}
Output: 0 2 1
Explanation: 10 is the least element so it
is replaced by 0. 40 is the largest
element so it is replaced by 3-1 = 2. And
20 is the 2nd smallest element so it is
replaced by 1.


Solution:

void convert(int arr[], int n) {
	    int temp[n];
	    copy_n(arr,n,temp);
	    sort(temp,temp+n);
	    unordered_map<int,int> m;
	    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
	     m[temp[i]]=i;
	    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
	    {
	        arr[i]=m[arr[i]];
	    }
	    return;
	}
