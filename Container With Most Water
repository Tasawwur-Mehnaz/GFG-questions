Given N non-negative integers a1,a2,....an where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). N vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i 
is at (i, ai) and (i,0). 
Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that it contains the most water.
Note : In Case of single verticle line it will not be able to hold water.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 4
a[] = {1,5,4,3}
Output: 6
Explanation: 5 and 3 are distance 2 apart.
So the size of the base = 2. Height of
container = min(5, 3) = 3. So total area
= 3 * 2 = 6.

Solution:

#define ll long long
long long maxArea(long long a[], int len)
{
    int i=0,j=len-1;
    ll maxarea=0;
    while(i<j)
    {
        maxarea=max(maxarea,(j-i)*min(a[i],a[j]));
        if(a[i]<a[j])
          i++;
        else
          j--;
    }
    return maxarea;
}
